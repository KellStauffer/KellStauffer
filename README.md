# KellStauffer

This is the personal repository for McKell Stauffer.
It contains the code for a few of my deep learning projects.
Additionally, it contains a few of the papers that I have written.

## papers

This folder contains a few of the papers that I have written.
One has been submitted to an academic journal for publishing.
The other two will not be submitted to journals, but describe machine learning projects that I have worked on.

### poetry-generation.pdf

This is a rough draft of a paper describing a poetry generation project using RNNs that I did with a fellow student.

### rigid-motion-conical.pdf

This is the paper that has been submitted to an academic journal.
It analyzes the rigid motion of a four-bar mechanism on a cone.
Although it has nothing to do with machine learning, it is representative of the work that I have submitted to academic journals.

### speech-popularity-predictor.pdf

This rough draft details a project where we used natural language processing to predict the popularity of a text based off of its contents.
In particular, we predicted the range of page views a transcribed speech given at Brigham Young University would receive.

## code

This folder contains code for 4 deep learning projects that I have done.
All labs were done in Tensorflow.

### CancerDetector.py

In this project, I used a convolutional neural network to predict whether an image of a lung showed signs of cancer.

### GAN.py

This project uses a generative adversarial network generate facial images from a random draw from the normal distribution.

### Inceptionism.py

This project uses networks to change the style of a photo to a style of another.
In other words, I take the style of one photo and the content of another and generate a new image.

### RNN.py

This project uses a recurrent neural network to generate text in a Markov Chain like fashion.
I used it to generate verses from the Bible and Taylor Swift lyrics.
It is the base code that I used my poetry generation project.
