# KellStauffer

This is an old repository for McKell Woodland (previously Stauffer).
It contains the code for a few of my very early deep learning projects (2017).

## code

This folder contains code for 4 deep learning projects that I have done.
All labs were done in Tensorflow.

### CancerDetector.py

In this project, I used a convolutional neural network to predict whether an image of a lung showed signs of cancer.

### GAN.py

This project uses a generative adversarial network generate facial images from a random draw from the normal distribution.

### Inceptionism.py

This project uses networks to change the style of a photo to a style of another.
In other words, I take the style of one photo and the content of another and generate a new image.

### RNN.py

This project uses a recurrent neural network to generate text in a Markov Chain like fashion.
I used it to generate verses from the Bible and Taylor Swift lyrics.
